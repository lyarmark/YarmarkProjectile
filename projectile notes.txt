log is the first line of defense if the program crashes
it can show the stack trace that you can go to

using the android debugger:

put a break point by clicking once in the gutter
run the application:

instead of clicking run, click the bug
this runs the entire program in debug mode
this is useful if you want to debug something in the onCreate
